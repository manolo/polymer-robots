A progressive and real-time (PWA) and PRPL application ready built on top of polymer with only 215 Lines of Code.

It was written for my talk at the Voxxed Days 2016 (Vienna).

It follows the standard structure of a project created with the `polymer-cli` tool.

Visit the live [demo](https://wc.demo.vaadin.com/robots/), then optionaly you could install it in your main screen.

To run locally, clone the project and run:

```
  $ bower install
  $ polymer serve
```

To compile for production run:

```
  $ polymer build
```

The following command serves the minified version of the app in an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:

```
   $ polymer serve build/unbundled
```
Or you can serve the minified version running this command: 

```
   $ polymer serve build/bundled
```
